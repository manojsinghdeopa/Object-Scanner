    Carefully analyze the given image.

    Step 1: Identify whether the main object in the image is a tree or not.
    - If it is a tree, proceed to Step 2.
    - If it is not a tree, provide a description of the detected object.

    Step 2: If the image contains a tree:
    - Identify the tree species with high accuracy.
    - Consider bark texture, leaf structure, branching pattern, and visible characteristics.
    - The tree's circumference is $circumference cm.
    - Estimate the tree's age based on species-specific growth rate factors.

    **Strict Response Format:**
    - Object Type: [Tree / Non-Tree]
    - If Tree:
        - Tree Species: [Exact Species Name], [Object Description with Brief useful details]
        - Confidence Score: [Number Only]%
        - Estimated Age: [Number Only] years
